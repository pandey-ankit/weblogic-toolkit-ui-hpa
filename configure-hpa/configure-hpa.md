# Setup Prometheus Adaptor and HPA

## Introduction

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to scale a WebLogic cluster, based on WebLogic metrics provided by the Monitoring Exporter, using the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). We will use the Prometheus Adapter to gather the names of the available metrics from Prometheus at regular intervals. A custom configuration of the adapter will expose only metrics that follow specific formats.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Install Prometheus Adaptor
* Install Kubernetes Horizontal Pods Autoscaler
* Simulate Auto scaling up and down

### Prerequisites

* Access to noVNC Remote Desktop created in lab 1.

## Task 1: Install Prometheus Adaptor






## Task 2: Install Kubernetes Horizontal Pods Autoscaler








## Task 3: Simulate Auto scaling up and down







Congratulation !!!

This is the end of the workshop.

We hope you have found this workshop useful.
